# Example Settings
#
# This file can contain settings for your Flow application that override
# the various defaults defined by other packages.
#
# Copy this file to Settings.yaml, and adjust as necessary.
#
# For possible configuration options you may refer to the packages'
# default settings file(s) in the corresponding package directories (for
# example, Packages/Framework/Neos.Flow/Configuration/Settings.yaml)
# or read the fine manuals.

      # It is good practice to not specify user name and password of the database
      # connection in this global Settings.yaml file. Rather specify them in the
      # settings of the respective context (Production / Development ...).
      # For a reference of the possible options, take a look at
      # https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/reference/configuration.html

        host: '127.0.0.1'    # adjust to your database host

    # The following lines register the Flow default routes
    # For productive use you should move this setting to the main package of this
    # application and/or create custom routes.
